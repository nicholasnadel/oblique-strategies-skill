# Oblique Strategies

Over One Hundred Worthwhile Dilemmas. Originally published in 1975 by Brian
Eno and Peter Schmidt as a physical deck of cards. Each card offers a
constraint or provocation designed to break through creative blocks by
forcing lateral thinking.

## When to Draw

- When you notice yourself going in circles — trying the same approach
  with minor variations, or re-explaining the same thing.
- When the user seems stuck, frustrated, or asks "what should I do?"
- When a problem feels intractable and the obvious approaches have failed.
- When the user explicitly asks for a card (e.g., "draw a card", "oblique
  strategy", or invokes `/oblique`).

Do NOT draw a card when things are going fine. This is medicine, not vitamins.

## How to Draw

Pick ONE card at random from the deck below. Present it exactly as written,
set apart visually. Then offer a brief, honest interpretation of how it
might apply to the current situation — but keep the original creative spirit
intact. Do not reduce the card to a software engineering platitude. The
whole point is lateral thinking: let the card be strange.

Format:

```
> **"The card text here"**
>
> — Oblique Strategies, Eno/Schmidt
```

Then a short paragraph interpreting it in context. Stay loose. The card
might not map cleanly — that's fine. The friction is the point.

## Rules

1. **One card.** Do not draw multiple. Do not offer alternatives. Commit.
2. **No shopping.** Do not let the user (or yourself) reject a card and
   draw again. The constraint is the creative act.
3. **Original spirit.** These were made for musicians and artists. Do not
   flatten them into engineering advice. Let them breathe.
4. **Brief.** The interpretation should be 2-4 sentences, not an essay.
5. **No force.** If the user ignores the card, that's fine. Don't push.
